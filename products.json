    "description": "Rocker Type Directional Rocker \u2013 A hybrid rocker/camber flex pattern defined by more tip rocker then tail rocker and camber between the bindings. The rockered tip floats the board\u2019s nose and improves maneuverability while the camber underfoot provides edge hold and response. A slightly rockered tail maintains the power and stability of a traditional board but helps keep the tail catch-free initiating turns and landing switch. Flex Personality / Flex: 4 \u2013 (1 = Soft and Playful, 5 = Stiff and Aggressive) Directional Flex Pattern Forever Flex \u2013 Forever Flex is a new manufacturing process that helps stabilize the flex and rocker of a board for its lifetime. Shape 3D Contour Base 3.0 \u2013 Freeride focused 3D Contour Base featuring a 7mm of spoon bevel in the nose and 0 - 7mm of spoon bevel in the tail. Spoon bevel starts at the rocker point. Progressive Sidecut \u2013 At the far ends of the sidecut, the radius is incrementally increased as the edge reaches the contact point. Gradually increasing the sidecut radius towards the contact point delivers smoother turn initiation and exit as the edge tracks in and out of the snow with a less abrupt transition. Blunt Nose \u2013 \"How a board glides in powder, crust, corn or any snow more than an inch deep is dictated by it's front contact point and just past it. Next time you are in soft snow watch how much snow comes over the corner of the nose near the contact point. The billowing snow coming out from behind the tip means you are plowing through it which is obviously slowing you down. By adding a blunt nose you get the float benefits of a much longer nose without the 'snow plow' rounded tip and it's extra swing weight.\" - Jeremy Jones 12.5mm Taper \u2013 The tapered shape sinks the tail in pow for better float and quicker turns. Core FSC\u2122 Power Core \u2013 Triple-density full wood core featuring hardwood bamboo stringers for added pop and durability plus paulownia for weight savings. V-Core \u2013 Boards with V-Cores are slightly softer in the very center of the board for improved manouverability and stiffer through the tip and tail for stability and pop. Laminates Triax Fiberglass \u2013 Multi-axis, stitched fiberglass laminate that offers a precise and responsive ride in any \u00adterrain or snow conditions. Sustainable Flax / Basalt Stringers \u2013 Jones exclusive sustainable stringer made with 100% natural fibers. Composite Flax and Basalt stringer helps transfer power power to the edges, improves torsional response and absorbs board chatter. Carbon / Innegra Reinforcement \u2013 Carbon Innegra fiber forms an ultra-tough hybrid composite layer that dampens the board torsionally and from tip to tail. Made in the USA and featured on the Aviator, Airheart, and Lone Wolf. Sidewalls Recycled ABS \u2013 ABS plastic is one of the necessary evils of snowboard production. Jones improves the sustainability of their snowboards by using only recycled plastic. Base Sintered 9900 Base \u2013 Sintered Ultra High Molecular Weight polyethylene with carbon additives. Flip Flop Base \u2013 Flip-Flop bases improve board sustainability by reducing p-tex waste (colorway may be the inverse of what is pictured). Edges Traction Tech 3.0 \u2013 Traction Tech 3.0 features three bumps per edge (front binding, board center, back binding). The middle bump is slightly bigger than the outside bumps for better grip. Oversized Recycled Edges \u2013 All Jones boards are made with oversized recycled steel edges for added durability and improved production sustainability. Topsheet FSC\u2122 Engineered Veneer \u2013 New composite wood veneer topsheets made from 100% FSC certified wood. Wood veneer topsheets dampen the ride and absorb chatter. Additional Features Bio Resin \u2013 All Jones boards are now built with bio-based, renewable epoxy instead of petroleum based epoxy. The raw materials used to make Super Sap Bio-Resin are co-products or waste products of other plant-based industrial processes. Producing Super Sap requires 33% less greenhouse gas emissions than conventional epoxy. Factory Tuned \u2013 All Jones snowboards are factory de-tuned at the tip and tail so you can go right from the shop to the mountain. Wend Natural Wax \u2013 Jones boards are ready to shred straight out of the shop and are factory waxed with WEND natural wax.

A zero camber section throughout the insert area provides a stable skate-style feel, while elevated contact points turn on a dime and float effortlessly in powder. Flex Twin Flex Flex Rating \u2013 4 (1 Soft - 10 Stiff) Shape Radial Sidecut \u2013 A RADIAL sidecut is a single radius design that allows your board to start and finish a turn on the same arc. Twin Shape Core FSC Certified Dual Core\u2122 \u2013 The FSC\u00ae CERTIFIED DUAL CORE\u2122 was built to achieve the consistent, dependable feel required from riders looking to take their skills to the next level. This lightweight core has zero irregularities and a consistent, uniform flex, combining lightweight Poplar with Beech for increased power and durability. Laminates Special Blend Fiberglass \u2013 This configuration uses an optimum blend of 626g/m2 Biaxial fiberglass laminated in conjunction with structural additives to customize performance objectives. Magic Bean Resin \u2013 This advanced resin system has a bio-content of 60% renewable, agricultural raw material and is produced with no waste or greenhouse emissions. In production, it has a low-temperature requirement with a high yield output. Poppy, powerful, and extremely durable, MAGIC BEAN\u2122 resin yields much stronger and more rigid qualities allowing a decrease in the wood core thickness. This means you get a lighter board while achieving higher energy return. Sidewalls Full ABS1000 Sidewalls Base Superdrive\u2122 Base \u2013 The SUPERDRIVE\u2122 base material lives in the Sintruded category of boards that deliver benefits of both sintered and extruded bases. These bases take the characteristics and manufacturing techniques used in creating extruded base material, but due to higher pressure and temperature, increase the surface hardness to levels near most sintered bases. This expands the durability and surface strength, creating a base that will be more durable when jibbing and ripping around the mountain while retaining a low maintenance and carefree lifespan of the board.

Shape Directional Twin \u2013 Symmetrical sidecut with more tip than tail rocker 3D Contour Base 2.0 \u2013 Moderate 3D-base contours featuring an even balance of 4mm spoon bevel in the nose and 4mm spoon bevel in the tail. Spoon bevel starts at the rocker point. Blunt Nose \u2013 \"How a board glides in powder, crust, corn or any snow more than an inch deep is dictated by it's front contact point and just past it. Next time you are in soft snow watch how much snow comes over the corner of the nose near the contact point. The billowing snow coming out from behind the tip means you are plowing through it which is obviously slowing you down. By adding a blunt nose you get the float benefits of a much longer nose without the 'snow plow' rounded tip and it's extra swing weight.\" - Jeremy Jones Core Power Core \u2013 Triple-density full wood core featuring hardwood bamboo stringers for added pop and durability plus paulownia for weight savings. Laminates Koroyd\u2122 \u2013 Koroyd\u2122 is the lightest, most advanced damping core material Jones has ever tested. Koroyd absorbs vibrations and adds response at a fraction of the weigh,t which enhances control and confidence. Power Sustainable Basalt Stringers \u2013 Sustainable stringers made with 100% natural fibers. Basalt stringers improve torsional response and transfer power from under your feet to the tips of the board to help eliminate nose and tail chatter.

Made in the USA and featured on the Aviator, Airheart, and Lone Wolf. Sidewalls Recycled ABS \u2013 ABS plastic is one of the necessary evils of snowboard production. Jones improves the sustainability of their snowboards by using only recycled plastic. Base Sintered 9900 Base \u2013 Sintered Ultra High Molecular Weight polyethylene with carbon additives. 3D Contour Base \u2013 Convex from the contact points outward for less catchiness, flat underfoot for precision edging. Edges Oversized Recycled Edges \u2013 All Jones boards are made with oversized recycled steel edges for added durability and improved production sustainability. Topsheet FSC\u2122 Ash Veneer \u2013 Thin wood veneer layer that functions as both a protective topsheet and a global reinforcement layer. The thin wood stringers that make up the wood topsheet provide even flex and suck up chatter from uneven snow conditions. Additional Features Bio Resin \u2013 All Jones boards are now built with bio-based, renewable epoxy instead of petroleum based epoxy. The raw materials used to make Super Sap Bio-Resin are co-products or waste products of other plant-based industrial processes. Producing Super Sap requires 33% less greenhouse gas emissions than conventional epoxy. Factory Tuned \u2013 All Jones snowboards are factory de-tuned at the tip and tail so you can go right from the shop to the mountain.

The rockered tip floats the board\u2019s nose and improves maneuverability while the camber underfoot provides edge hold and response. A slightly rockered tail maintains the power and stability of a traditional board but helps keep the tail catch-free initiating turns and landing switch. Flex Flex Rating \u2013 7 (1 Soft - 10 Stiff) Forever Flex \u2013 Forever Flex is a new manufacturing process that helps stabilize the flex and rocker of a board for its lifetime. Directional Flex Pattern Shape Blunt Nose \u2013 \"How a board glides in powder, crust, corn or any snow more than an inch deep is dictated by it's front contact point and just past it. Next time you are in soft snow watch how much snow comes over the corner of the nose near the contact point. The billowing snow coming out from behind the tip means you are plowing through it which is obviously slowing you down. By adding a blunt nose you get the float benefits of a much longer nose without the 'snow plow' rounded tip and it's extra swing weight.\" - Jeremy Jones Progressive Sidecut \u2013 At the far ends of the sidecut, the radius is incrementally increased as the edge reaches the contact point. Gradually increasing the sidecut radius towards the contact point delivers smoother turn initiation and exit as the edge tracks in and out of the snow with a less abrupt transition.

Flex Personality \u2013 2 - 5 (1 Soft - 10 Stiff) Twin Flex \u2013 The flex is perfectly symmetrical from tip to tail for a balanced ride that's equally versatile regular or switch. Shape Twin \u2013 Perfectly symmetrical for a balanced ride that's equally versatile regular or switch. Jib, spin, stomp, and butter with a greater balance of freestyle mobility and cat-like stability no matter which way you point it. Pro-Tip \u2013 A tapered tip and tail thickness reduces swing weight for easier mobility. Core Super Fly II\u2122 700G Core \u2013 Stronger and lighter woods target specific areas of the core to provide pop, strength, and reduced weight. Squeezebox \u2013 Burton's most versatile Squeezebox profile improves pop and performance through the balance of thicker, more powerful core sections with thinner, more flexible sections. Rider energy is transferred outward from beneath the feet, energizing the tip and tail while making the board snappier, more stable and easier to manipulate. Dualzone\u2122 EGD\u2122 \u2013 The wood grain is positioned along the toe and heel edges on two continuous zones, perpendicular to the rest of the wood core for consistent edge-hold and added strength. Laminates Triax\u2122 Fiberglass \u2013 Versatile flex and response for everything from mini to mega shred. Base Sintered Base \u2013 Durable and highly porous, get added durability and superior wax absorption for greater overall glide. Edges Frostbite Edges \u2013 Frostbite edges extend out slightly from the sidewall of the board for added bite when you need it and a smooth and buttery ride when you don't. Graphics Artist \u2013 Annie Spratt Additional Features Infinite Ride\u2122 \u2013 This Burton-exclusive technology allows maximized pop and strength by overbuilding the board, then putting it in a machine that breaks in the board for you. Whether you choose to ride Flat Top, Flying V\u2122, or Camber, rest assured that with Infinite Ride\u2122 your board will maintain its flex, pop, and feel from the first day forward, season after season. Super Sap\u00ae Epoxy \u2013 A resin formulated with bio-based materials that reduces the carbon footprint by 50% over conventional all-petroleum-based epoxies. Less oil consumption means even less of a carbon footprint per board. Binding Compatibility The Channel\u00ae Mounting System \u2013 Stronger, faster, easier, and more adjustable -- The Channel\u2122 gives you ultimate control of your stance and your board in a design compatible with all major bindings (not just Burton's). Channel Inserts Included \u2013 Channel Inserts are required to mount your bindings. Inspect packaging before disposing."

A flat section in the rocker area provides a broad contact point when flexed, but allows the board to track straight and not catch when unbent. Flanking this straight section are two shallow radii, which provide the second and third contact points. Towards the ends of the sidecut are deep radii which render quick turn initiation and the final contact points. The asymmetrical version of the Vario sidecut puts a longer radius on the toe side and a shorter radius on the heel side.

SWRC features longer camber areas under the bindings for huge pop and vice like stability with a smaller rocker area in between that retains quick turn initiation and flotation. The hallmarks of the patented Rocker Camber Profile. Extended Transition Area \u2013 Never Summer adds a small flat section in the snowboard profile that improves both turn initiation and powder flotation. Flex Flex Rating \u2013 6 (1 Soft - 10 Stiff) Dampness Rating \u2013 6 (1 Lively - 10 Damp) Shape Vario Power Grip Sidecut \u2013 Vario Power Grip Sidecut utilizes multiple radii creating extra contact points to enhance edge hold. A flat section in the rocker area provides a broad contact point when flexed, but allows the board to track straight and not catch when unbent. Flanking this straight section are two shallow radii, which provide the second and third contact points. Towards the ends of the sidecut are deep radii which render quick turn initiation and the final contact points Low Profile Tip/Tail \u2013 A low profile in the nose and tail of the snowboard maximizes material contact with the snow for more powerful ollie/nollie pop and stability to your landings. Low Profile Tip/Tail also reduces the plowing effect in the nose for better glide to the next feature and superior float when it's deep. Core NS Superlight Wood Core \u2013 Never Summer's Superlight core uses a custom blend of Poplar, Paulownia and Birch woods that was created to be the lightest weight yet durable core on the market. Laminates Recluse Web Carbon Layup \u2013 Strategically positioned to stiffen the board at the ends for edge hold pressure, spring, and stability.

RDS 2 Damping System \u2013 This lightweight system uses three narrower laminated dampening layers that provide the perfect combination of vibration, absorption, and stability. RDS 2 is the perfect balance of freeride stability and freestyle liveliness. Elastomeric Underfoot Stabilizers \u2013 Elastomeric Underfoot Stabilizers directly below the mounting area provide optimum vibration absorption and increase high-speed stability while reducing foot fatigue. Harmonic Tip / Tail Damper \u2013 Harmonic Dampers in the tip and tail take out a high percentage of residual vibration by quieting the nose and tail. This enhances stability at speed, in variable snow conditions and on board landings without deadening the liveliness and pop of the cambered areas. Sidewalls Sintered UHMW Polyethylene Sidewalls \u2013 Never Summer was the first snowboard company to use and perfect Sintered P-Tex Sidewalls, and they've never seen one crack.

The rockered tip floats the board\u2019s nose and improves maneuverability while the camber underfoot provides edge hold and response. A slightly rockered tail maintains the power and stability of a traditional board but helps keep the tail catch-free initiating turns and landing switch. Flex Directional Flex Pattern Flex Rating \u2013 4 (1 Soft - 10 Stiff) Forever Flex \u2013 Forever Flex is a new manufacturing process that helps stabilize the flex and rocker of a board for its lifetime.

Spoon bevel starts just after the rocker point. Progressive Sidecut \u2013 At the far ends of the sidecut, the radius is incrementally increased as the edge reaches the contact point.

    "description": "Flex Medium-Stiff Flex \u2013 Helps with quick, technical maneuvers, even at high speeds. Great for all-mountain carving, powerful freeriding and charging through the terrain park. Baseplate Re:Flex\u2122 Binding System \u2013 Offers more flex, feel, and cushioning than traditional disc bindings, in a package that's universally compatible with all current mounting systems, including 4x4, 3D\u00ae (via Burton Rider Service, sold separately), and the Channel\u00ae. The minimized, cored base-plate with Living Hinge\u2122 disc reduces the weight and footprint of the binding, while also bending freely for a more natural flex. Single-Component Lightweight, Bomb-Proof Polycarbonate Re:Flex\u2122 \u2013 One material throughout the baseplate creates consistent response and feel for all-terrain domination. Re:Flex\u2122 FullBED Cushioning System \u2013 Offers full underfoot cushioning that maximizes comfort while minimizing fatigue. Anchored to the baseplate, the stealth trap door design makes it easy to access the mounting hardware. Highback Single Component Construction \u2013 The simplicity of a one-piece hi-back means immediate response. Using Burton's book of material secrets, they can manipulate the overall flex profile -- from buttery to responsive. Zero-Lean Canted Hi-Back Design \u2013 Your legs don't go straight up, and neither should your hi-backs. This ergonomic design follows the natural contours of your left and right legs to maximize control and comfort. Riders who prefer a more playful and relaxed feel will dig the Zero Forward\nLean design on select hi\u2011backs. As always, you can still choose to crank \u2018em forward for quicker control when carving or climbing icy pipe walls. MicroFLAD\u2122 \u2013 The higher the Forward Lean angle on your hi-backs, the quicker you heel-edge turns. Crank them forward for icy hits in the pipe or back them off for jibbing. Tool-free and micro-adjustable for easy fine-tuning and maximum angle options. Straps Reactstrap\u2122 \u2013 Minimized construction that houses a 3D\u00ae curved triple axis spine with an ultra-responsive wrap that conforms to any boot. Supergrip Capstrap\u2122 \u2013 The Supergrip Capstrap\u2122 delivers optimal fit and function with an ultra-minimalist, glueless, stitchless, and PU-free injection molded strap component that works both as a capstrap\u2122 or over the toe. Simple and super durable. Flex Slider \u2013 Makes strapping-in a breeze with a strategically stretched hinging zone that allows the heel strap to flex and fall fully open. Thanks to science of forced molecular alignment, the Flex Slider is also incredibly strong. Buckles Smooth Glide\u2122 Buckles \u2013 Lightweight aluminum and polycarbonate levers give you season after season of buttery smooth and reliable ratcheting power. Additional Features Compatible with All Major Mounting Systems \u2013 Please note, the 3D Hinge Disc is required for mounting on 3D systems (not included). Re-Ground Materials to Reduce Waste"

Riders who prefer a more playful and relaxed feel will dig the Zero Forward\nLean design on select hi\u2011backs. As always, you can still choose to crank \u2018em forward for quicker control when carving or climbing icy pipe walls. Kickback Hammock \u2013 A lighter weight upgrade to the heel hammock, this two-piece heel hugging hiback is literally suspension in a hiback. Dynamic interaction between an internal spring and rubber over molded hammock results in increased response and reduced vibration while your heel is cradled in complete suspension. MicroFLAD\u2122 \u2013 The higher the Forward Lean angle on your hi-backs, the quicker you heel-edge turns. Crank them forward for icy hits in the pipe or back them off for jibbing. Tool-free and micro-adjustable for easy fine-tuning and maximum angle options. 18% Short-Glass / Nylon Composite \u2013 A high\u2011performance blend featuring ramped up strength in a soft\u2011flexing package. Straps Hammockstrap\u2122 \u2013 Reactstrap roots in a stitch\u2011less construction for ultra\u2011response with minimal materials. The addition of a nylon cross spine equals a more direct connection with the board. Supergrip Capstrap\u2122  2.0 \u2013 Minimalist design merges two materials into one technologically advanced toe strap. A firmer material in the spine provides a supportive and lightweight skeleton, while a softer over-molded material improves boot wrap and comfort. Featuring Ultra-minimized and fully injected with an over-molded design. Made ultra-durable, glue-less, stitch-less and PU-free construction. 3D curved with a triple axis spine as well as a true wrap toe window. Flex Slider \u2013 Makes strapping-in a breeze with a strategically stretched hinging zone that allows the heel strap to flex and fall fully open. Thanks to science of forced molecular alignment, the Flex Slider is also incredibly strong. Buckles Double Take Buckles with Insta-Click \u2013 Be the first to drop in with the rapid ratcheting of Burton's Double Take Buckles. Helical teeth and \"Insta-Click\" engagement combine for increased torque per crank, faster uptake, and fewer cranks to tighten. The result: vastly improved strength, speed and ease of use. Additional Features Mounts Exclusively with Burton Boards Featuring The Channel\u2122 Re-Ground Materials to Reduce Waste"

This material is extremely light and strong, reducing overall buckle weight by 20%. Additional Features Skate Tech \u2013 Inspired by how easily and efficiently a skateboard turns, Skate Tech mimics the function of skateboard trucks. Traditional bindings diminish energy transfer by flexing and bending the baseplate, forcing you to crank straps down harder, ride with more forward lean, or run taller and stiffer highbacks. Skate Tech bindings bypass the middle of the snowboard and direct your energy right onto the board's edges, transfering more power to the board with less work. Highcup Compatibility \u2013 Compatible with all hangers. Low profile for extra flexibility. Street, park and pow. Bushings \u2013 Available in Medium (45 Shore) Combo Mounting Disc 4x4 - Channel \u2013 Mounting disc is Nylon reinforced. 4x4 and Channel compatibility. Minimal board fixture. Light and strong"

    "description": "Flex Medium Flex \u2013 The happy medium of binding flex. Medium flex models perform equally on all terrain. Great for progression - responsive, comfortable and forgiving. Baseplate Single-Component Lightweight, Bomb-Proof Polycarbonate Re:Flex\u2122 \u2013 One material throughout the baseplate creates consistent response and feel for all-terrain domination. Re:Flex\u2122 Binding System \u2013 Offers more flex, feel, and cushioning than traditional disc bindings, in a package that's universally compatible with all current mounting systems, including 4x4, 3D\u00ae (via Burton Rider Service, sold separately), and the Channel\u00ae. The minimized, cored base-plate with Living Hinge\u2122 disc reduces the weight and footprint of the binding, while also bending freely for a more natural flex. Re:Flex\u2122 FullBED Cushioning System \u2013 Offers full underfoot cushioning that maximizes comfort while minimizing fatigue. Anchored to the baseplate, the stealth trap door design makes it easy to access the mounting hardware. Highback Single Component Construction \u2013 The simplicity of a one-piece hi-back means immediate response. Using Burton's book of material secrets, they can manipulate the overall flex profile -- from buttery to responsive. Canted Hi-Back Design \u2013 Your legs don't go straight up, and neither should your high backs. This ergonomic design follows the natural contours of your left and right legs to maximize control and comfort. MicroFLAD\u2122 \u2013 The higher the Forward Lean angle on your hi-backs, the quicker you heel-edge turns. Crank them forward for icy hits in the pipe or back them off for jibbing. Tool-free and micro-adjustable for easy fine-tuning and maximum angle options. Straps Reactstrap\u2122 \u2013 Minimized construction that houses a 3D\u00ae curved triple axis spine with an ultra-responsive wrap that conforms to any boot. Supergrip Capstrap\u2122 \u2013 The Supergrip Capstrap\u2122 delivers optimal fit and function with an ultra-minimalist, glueless, stitchless, and PU-free injection molded strap component that works both as a capstrap\u2122 or over the toe. Simple and super durable. Buckles Smooth Glide\u2122 Buckles \u2013 Lightweight aluminum and polycarbonate levers give you season after season of buttery smooth and reliable ratcheting power. Additional Features Re-Ground Materials to Reduce Waste Compatible with All Major Mounting Systems \u2013 Please note, the 3D Hinge Disc is required for mounting on 3D systems (not included)."
